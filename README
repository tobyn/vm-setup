This set of scripts is used, in conjunction with VirtualBox, to build an
Ubuntu 16.04 VM.

Start by creating the VM, then install Ubuntu 16.04 from the "mini" ISO.
During package selection, uncheck everything. Remove the install disc,
then reboot.

When the new Ubuntu system comes up, log in. Use apt to install curl,
wget, scp, or whatever, and use it to copy over the vm-setup script. Run
it using your account (it will sudo when required).

Once vm-setup has finished, reboot. If you want Docker, run
vm-docker-setup when the system comes back up.

vm-setup installs the following:
  * alsa-utils - required for sound to work
  * build-essential - required to build software
  * chromium-browser - web browser
  * feh - sets desktop background
  * git - required to clone dotfiles
  * i3 - tiling window manager
  * nodm - facilitates auto-login
  * psmisc - contains 'killall'
  * vim-gtk3 - editor
  * xorg - graphics
